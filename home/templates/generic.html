							The present study proposes a novel method of trend detection and visualization - more specifically, modeling the change in a topic over time. Where current models used for the identification and visualization of trends only convey the popularity of a singular word based on stochastic counting of usage, the approach in the present study illustrates the popularity and direction that a topic is moving in. The direction in this case is a distinct subtopic within the selected corpus. Such trends are generated by modeling the movement of a topic by using k-means clustering and cosine similarity to group the distances between clusters over time. In a convergent scenario, it can be inferred that the topics as a whole are meshing (tokens between topics, becoming interchangeable). On the contrary, a divergent scenario would imply that each topics' respective tokens would not be found in the same context (the words are increasingly different to each other). The methodology was tested on a group of articles from various media houses present in the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

						<p style="text-align: left;">
							Word2Vec [9] can utilize either of two model architectures to produce a distributed representation of words: continuous bag-of-words (CBoW) or continuous skip-gram. In the continuous bag-of-words architecture, the model predicts the current word from a window of surrounding context words (window size). The order of context words does not influence prediction (bag-of-words assumption). In the continuous skip-gram architecture, the model uses the current word to predict the surrounding window of context words. The skip-gram architecture weighs nearby context words more heavily than most distant context words. The need for word prediction when the goal is to generate embeddings comes from the nature of language which is unlabeled. To overcome this, an artificial task is created for the neural network: predict a targeted word from its context and vice versa in a skip-gram. Although the inputs and outputs of the single layer neural network are not the objective, the weights that feed into the final softmax layer will be the eventual embeddings that convey the input word’s semantic meaning. The softmax, multinomial distribution can be defined as follows:

							<!-- First paragraph methodology PARAPHRASED-->
							The current study posits that in a controlled and consistent environment, where comparable corpora pertaining to the same topic or sub-topic are generated, such as in the case of a fashion magazine or financial newspaper, the frequency of a particular word or topic being discussed correlates with its degree of association with the overarching field. For instance, in the context of a sports magazine, as the Olympics approach, the topic of track and field becomes more closely linked with the broader term of sports.

							<!-- Second paragraph methodology EXACT WORDS -->
							To demonstrate the effectiveness of the aforementioned framework, two case studies were performed comparing the relation between various themes of trends related to specific and arbitrary events. To implement the above mentioned ideology, the two main steps that were to be taken into account are the preparation of data by carving out the corpora on the basis of time (the time period of comparison being ’months’ in present study), hence creating corresponding Word2Vec models for each slice, as well as formulating word trends over all the created models.
							<br></br>

							The 20 Newsgroups dataset utilized in this study comprises approximately 21,000 documents or posts related to 20 distinct topics or subtopics, including but not limited to atheism, religion, basketball, and space. While some of these topics demonstrate a high degree of similarity, such as "PC hardware" versus "mac hardware," others exhibit little or no relation, such as "for sale" versus "Christianity." This particular dataset was deemed the most appropriate option for the purposes of this research. The data was divided into two separate subsets: one for training or development, and the other for testing or performance evaluation. The division between the train and test sets was based on the chronological order of the messages, with a specific date serving as the dividing point.
