FILE DESCRIPTION: generate.py

This script generates trend data for nursing home inspection reports by computing similarity scores
between a base term and a set of related terms across multiple Word2Vec models. Each model represents
a different time period (e.g., 'jan23') and is dynamically loaded from the 'models/' directory.

The trends are derived based on cosine similarity scores, providing insights into how related terms
vary in relation to the base term across different time periods.

Optimizations:

- Processes models in parallel using multiprocessing to improve speed.
- Utilizes Gensim's built-in `similarity` method for efficient computation.
- Checks for word existence in the vocabulary before attempting similarity computation.
- Manages memory usage by controlling the number of worker processes.

    Generates trend data by calculating cosine similarity scores between a base term and multiple related terms

    Notes:
    - If a term is missing in any model, a default similarity score of -1.0 is assigned for that model.
